      <description>Who decides what is truly correct when it comes down to a human&amp;rsquo;s fitness. If you join any nutrition groups on social media you&amp;rsquo;ll see a wide variety of diet opions, some backed by science and some touting how the science is wrong. If you look for something to justify what you&amp;rsquo;re consuming you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find someone on your side and probably find someone opposed to you. Also, there has always been this conventional knowledge you would receive if you talk to your average person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t look into this stuff at all.</description>
